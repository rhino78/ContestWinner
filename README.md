Tweeting out some contests to win some free swag

Wanted to automate re-tweeting of any tweets that contain the words "Rt to win" to see if I could get some free swag. After about a year of enhancing and working with this I can saftely say that I won about 0.01% of the time. Got some 'ok' stuff but otherwise, it's not worth the hassle. As they say "nothing in life is free"
